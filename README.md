# Math Visualization Library
Python library designed to visualize mathematical concepts
Math Visualization Library
The Math Visualization Library is a Python library designed to facilitate the visualization of various mathematical concepts and data. It has functions and utilities for visual appeal in the field of mathematics.

**Features**
**Line Plots**: Generate line plots to visualize mathematical functions, curves, or data series._**
**Scatter plots**: Create scatter plots to visualize the distribution and relationships between data points.
**Bar Graphs**: Generate bar graphs to represent categorical or numerical data_.**
**Histograms**: Create histograms to display the distribution of numerical data._
**Geometric shapes**: Generate various geometric shapes such as points, lines, circles, polygons, and 3D objects.
**Fractals**: Explore and visualize fractal patterns, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and the Sierpinski triangle.

**Dependencies**
The Math Visualization Library is built using the standard Python library, which is typically included with the Python installation. 
Python (version 3.7 or higher) - The programming language used for the library.
Matplotlib (version 3.4.0 or higher) - A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
NumPy (version 1.20.0 or higher) - A library for numerical computations in Python, often used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.

Installation

Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).

Install dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Download the library: Clone or download the Math Visualization Library from the GitHub repository.

Import and use: In your Python script, import the necessary functions or modules from the library and start visualizing mathematical concepts and data.

Usage
The Math Visualization Library provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating visualizations. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the library to generate a line plot:

python
Copy
import math_visualization as mv

# Generate sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Create a line plot
mv.line_plot(x, y)

# Show the plot
mv.show_plot()

Refer to the library's examples folder for more detailed usage instructions
