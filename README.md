Usage
The Math Visualization Library provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating visualizations. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the library to generate a line plot:

python
Copy
import math_visualization as mv

# Generate sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Create a line plot
mv.line_plot(x, y)

# Show the plot
mv.show_plot()

Refer to the library's examples folder for more detailed usage instructions
